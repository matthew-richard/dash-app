An Android app allowing geocaching of actual money using the Venmo and Google Maps APIs. E.g. setting up races to specific locations that automatically trigger Venmo transactions.

Implemented during JHU Hophacks Spring 2015 on team of 4. Won 3rd prize.

Alas, the app can't be published due to it violating the Venmo terms of service.

7. ~~Proximity Stuff~~
8. implement UDP messages instead of HTTP requests
